================================================================================
Requirements:
1. Linux kernel version >= 2.6 or the aio library.
2. pthreads library.

================================================================================
Building the shared library:

1. Go to the lib directory.
2. Type "make".
3. libeventdisp.so will be created at the build library.

================================================================================
Running the unit tests.

1. Make sure that the libeventdisp.so is already built before resuming.
2. Go to test/unit.
3. Type "make".
4. Run "all_test" to run all test or choose an individual test to run.

================================================================================
Getting started:

Please check the tests in test/unit directory to get a feel on how to use this 
library. The comments in lib/inc/dispatcher.h also has a good overview.

================================================================================
Note:

The library will be installed in the /usr/lib in the future on stable release, 
but during the alpha version, it will just in the build directory, so an error
will occur when trying to run the binary since it can't find the library. The 
temporary solution for this is to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the 
location of the library before running the binary. For example, in Ubuntu, type
the following when inside the test/unit directory:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../build
